# Code Institute, Milestone 3: hash-board

## Introduction

In response to the financial crisis of 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper outlining the first decentralised public ledger technology to hit the world stage.
The network has stood strong to this day and inspired 1000s of projects build off of Satoshi's vision of a decentralised world. We now have a robust ecosystem of smart contract, NFT and decentralised financed platforms.
Pandora's box has been opened and there is no turning back.

One of the main benefits of cryptocurrencies is the public availability of the blockchain data. Previously corporations would protect vast silos of data in order to monetize it & increase their stranglehold on the market.
Public blockchains granted software developers to the ability to compete with much larger corporations by providing value to the user & not by monetizing siloed data.

Even though cryptocurrencies have been around for more than a decade, adoption rates are still relatively low. I believe this is due to the perceived complexity of the technology.
My goal for my Code Institute Milestone Project 3: Data Centric is to simplify the experience for the user by allowing them to view their blockchain data in a more intuitive graphical interface.

#### Current Blockchain Interfaces

This cryptocurrency dashboard project will be reading transactions from the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is the market leader in smart contract technology with the largest community & developer base.
Etherscan is the leading blockchain API which allows you to view transactions, smart contracts, user accounts & on-chain metrics. After using Etherscan for the past 4 years, I have seen that very few improvements have been made to the UX. 
I believe this is the key to onboarding new users and taking smart contract platforms to the next level.

#### Planned Features


## Considerations

## UX


### Project Goals

My original idea was to introduce new people to the cryptocurrency ecosystem by creating a user-friendly interface to allow users to view their transactions in a more intuitive way.
This will allow users to view their blockchain transactions with more clarity & reduce some of the anxiety that new user will face when starting out in crypto.
This application doesn't just limit you to viewing your own transactions, the user will be able to search any transaction on the Ethereum chain and save it to their dashboard.
With this feature, users can track Ethereum whales & the movement of funds within important smart contracts. Many forensic accounting techniques can be preformed using this web application.

### User Goals

The target audience for this application reflects people within the age group of your average cryptocurrency user (16-35).

##### The user's goals are:

* To be provided with blockchain data in a format that is easy to navigate and understand.
* To use public blockchain data in order to track funds moving through the ecosystem.
* Prioritise specific transactions.
* Add small pieces of text to priority transactions.
* Update text related to priority transactions.

##### Hashboard satisfies these needs by:
* Creating a clean data layout with any unnecessary information removed.
* Allowing the user to search transactions from any public Ethereum address.
* Giving the user the ability to favourite priority transactions.
* The user is then able to add important text information related to that transaction.
* This information can be edited if it becomes outdated.
* Once a user is finished needing to view this transactions, their favourites list can be reset.

### Developer & Business Goals


##### Developer Goals

* Due to this project being my first Python web application, my main goal was to learn as much as possible about Python web development.
* In the future, I would like to work as smart contract developer. This project, even though it doesn't use any smart contract, is a great project to have in my portfolio.
* To provide an application which is a useful tool to the crypto community.
* The application should also keep the user coming back regularly due to the necessity of the product.

##### Business Goals

* Use the application's traffic to sell advertising.
* (Future Feature) Create a premium tier account for heavy users.

##### Tier Structure (Future Feature)

Limit the user to a set number of blockchain searches & favourited transactions. This will incentivise active users to upgrade to the premium tier.

Premium tier users will have unlimited access to search and adding favourite transactions.

### User Stories


1. As a user of this web application I want:
    * A clean and enjoyable UX, everything should be where I want it.
    * Fonts that are legible but something a bit different to the norm.
    * Little to no load times when the website first starts or has to complete a process.

2. As somebody looking to advertise on this website I would like:
    * Content that is family friendly and not provocative so our brand doesn't become tarnished.
    * Heavy user traffic in order to get our brand in front of as many eyeballs as possible.
    * Fast load times to ensure impatient users don't leave the site.


### User Stories Testing

### Design Choices

##### Responsive Front-End Framework

For this project, I decided to use the Materialize framework which is build on the principles of material design.
After completing the project using this new framework, I can safely say that I prefer it more then Bootstrap which I have used on my previous 2 milestone projects.
It appears to provide more feedback to the user when they are navigating throughout the web application while remaining responsive on most devices.
